# MarketData Overview

The MarketData package provides open-source financial data for research
and testing.

The data is from [Quandl](http://www.quandl.com/WIKI) and is free
end-of-day stock data. It is public domain without restrictions.

The TimeSeries TimeArray data structure is used to store the data, but
conversion to other data structures, including DataFrames and
AxisArrays, is supported.
